# Architecture Boundaries, Workarounds, Tech Debt

Purpose: respect the project's layering; make every shortcut visible.

## Boundaries

- Follow the project's existing architecture. Forbidden: business logic in
  UI or controllers when a service layer exists; SQL in API routes when a
  repository layer exists; bypassing existing services/abstractions without
  cause; circular module dependencies; dumping unrelated logic into
  catch-all files.
- If the architecture genuinely blocks the task, do not hack around it —
  propose a proper structural change and reflect it in the architecture
  docs once approved.

## Temporary solutions

- Workarounds are allowed only exceptionally, and every one must be recorded
  explicitly: why it exists, where it lives, its limits and risks, and when
  it must be replaced.
- Hidden workarounds are forbidden. Do not scatter uncontrolled
  `TODO`/`FIXME` marks; important debt gets a task or an entry in the
  project's tracking process.

## Tech debt

- Debt found during a task that cannot be fixed now is recorded explicitly
  (in the final report at minimum), never disguised as a normal solution.
- Debt touching security, data integrity, performance, or stability is
  priority debt — call it out loudly.
