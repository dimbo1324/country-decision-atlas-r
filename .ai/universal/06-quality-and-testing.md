# Quality: Tests, Errors, Data, Contracts, Performance

Purpose: changes are verified, honest about failure, and safe to release.

## Tests

- Cover new or changed code where reasonable: the happy path, validation
  errors, edge cases, access rights, repository/service behavior, API
  responses, and regressions for fixed bugs.
- NEVER delete, disable, or weaken tests just to make a build green.
- If tests were not added, say why in the final report.
- Prefer the project's designated check runner over ad-hoc command
  sequences, and keep that runner updated when the task adds an important
  new part of the system.

## Errors and logging

- Handle errors explicitly. Forbidden: silently swallowed errors, empty
  catch/except blocks, debug logs left after the task, secrets or personal
  data in logs, `console.log`-style debugging instead of real handling.
- Logs must say where it broke, which component, what context matters, and
  how critical it is. Useful, not noisy.

## Database migrations

- Schema changes happen ONLY through migrations.
- Never edit or rename an already-applied migration; never delete migrations
  without a separate decision; never make irreversible changes without risk
  analysis; never hand-edit production data without an agreed plan.
- Verify each migration on a clean database, on an existing database when
  applicable, and together with the code that uses the new structure.

## API contracts

- When a task changes an API, update the contract and generated types.
- Never silently change field names, data types, response structure, error
  codes, parameter requiredness, endpoint behavior, pagination, or filters.
- Any breaking change must be named explicitly in the final report.

## Performance

- No premature optimization, but no obviously wasteful patterns: N+1
  queries, heavy per-request computation, render loops, unpaginated large
  reads, redundant network calls, blocking operations in hot paths.
- If a change may affect performance, say so in the final report.

## Releases and feature flags

- Every change should be revertible; for risky changes plan the rollback
  before merging.
- Large new features ship behind a feature flag where the project supports
  them; unfinished functionality must not be reachable by accident; stale
  flags get removed after stabilization.
