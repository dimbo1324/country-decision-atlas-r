# Task Checklist and Definition of Done

Purpose: every task is planned before it starts and honestly accounted for
after it ends, in a file any reviewer can read without the conversation.

## task-checklist.md protocol

A file named `task-checklist.md` lives in the repository root and is always
tracked by git (never in `.gitignore`).

Before starting a task:

1. Clear or recreate `task-checklist.md` for the new task.
2. Write the main stages, checks, and expected outcomes as `[ ]` items,
   grouped into short sections (preparation / implementation / verification /
   completion). Moderate detail — stages, not keystrokes.
3. Commit and push the checklist BEFORE doing the main work.

After finishing the task:

4. Mark every item: `+` done, `-` not done or partially done.
5. Commit the filled checklist together with the completed work.
6. Never hide unfinished items — a `-` with an honest note is correct;
   a silently ignored item is a violation.

## Definition of Done

A task is complete only when ALL of the following hold:

- code written and matching the task, without unrequested scope
- code formatted; lint/type checks pass
- tests added or updated where reasonable; existing tests pass
- project builds; no obvious errors in logs
- no secrets, no temp files, no accidental changes in unrelated files
- architecture docs updated if the task changed architecture
- task checklist filled with `+`/`-`
- final report written

## Final report

The final report is ALWAYS the last step of a task. It states: what was done;
which files/areas changed; which checks ran and their results; dependency,
API, DB, or config changes; security/performance/compatibility risks; and —
explicitly and honestly — anything that was not done or failed.
