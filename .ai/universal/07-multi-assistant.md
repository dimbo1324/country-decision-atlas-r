# Multi-Assistant Collaboration

Purpose: several AI assistants (and humans) work on this repo in separate
sessions; git is the coordination surface and the rule modules are shared.

## Coordination through git

- Before non-trivial work, check `git log --oneline -10` and
  `git status --short --branch`: recent commits may be another assistant's
  finished work — not yours to redo or second-guess.
- Never rewrite history on another assistant's in-flight branch. Build on
  top of it or ask first.
- Keep commits attributable: include the assistant identity trailer the
  project already uses (see recent `git log` for the convention).

## Shared rule modules

- All assistants obey the same rules from `.ai/universal/` and
  `.ai/project/`. There is exactly one source of truth.
- `CLAUDE.md` imports the modules natively; `AGENTS.md` is GENERATED from
  them. Never hand-edit `AGENTS.md`; edit the module and regenerate
  (see the project commands module for the sync command).
- When a task changes shared behavior (workflow, gates, style, guardrails),
  change the module once — both assistants pick it up. Mirror-maintained
  per-assistant files (`.claude/` skills/agents vs their Codex equivalents)
  still need the same edit on both sides in the same task.

## Session hygiene for any model

- Re-read plans and rule files from disk instead of trusting memory of a
  previous session — files change between sessions.
- When context is shaky or the task is large, restate the task's acceptance
  criteria in the checklist before coding, and verify against files, not
  recollection.
- If two rules appear to conflict: the project module wins over the
  universal module; an explicit owner instruction in the current
  conversation wins over both. Say out loud which rule you chose and why.
